# Caesar Cipher GUI Application

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

- Features:
- Encryption: Encrypts a given plaintext message using a specified key.
- Decryption: Decrypts a given ciphertext message using the same key used for encryption.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive GUI built using tkinter and ttk for Python.
